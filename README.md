# discourse-disable-annoying-new-features-notice

#### What Does this Plugin Do

This simple configurable Discourse plugin marks the "new features" notice in the admin dashboard as "seen" so Discourse self-hosting admins do not have to see and dismiss the notice.  It also provides an option to remove the fixed notice from the bottom of the admin dashboard page.
